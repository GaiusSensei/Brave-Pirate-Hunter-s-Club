These are a list of skillplans that are optimized for our pirate hunting doctrines. Note that the BRAVE Alliance skillplans are different from these; there are significant overlap, but these are primarily Gallente focused, while BRAVE focuses on Caldari.  

## Newly Created Character

You made your Eve Online avatar! Congratulations! Before you start your tutorial, set the following skills to your skill training queue:

That should take __7 hours__- plently of time to complete the tutorial, send an application to the BRAVE Alliance, and make your way to GE-8JV. You're gonna need a ton of skill books, and [the BRAVE Dojo can provide those for free](https://imgur.com/BSNq3bo). Every newly made character in Eve Online starts with the following skills:

* [Race] Frigate II

## Optional BRAVE Skillplan

Losing a lot of ships? Having a tough time fitting the [Pirate Hunter's Doctrines](/doctrines)? or even the BRAVE Doctrines? These are a set of essential Hull, Engineering and Rigging skills that you can train in order to help with damage mitigation and make ship fitting quite a bit easier. We suggest using these to 'pad' your training queue if there's some space at the very end. Note that these plan assumes that you have successfully completed the BRAVE Starter Kit above.

| Skill Name | Level | Time | Notes |
|:-----------|:-----:|:-----|:------|
| Hull Upgrades | 2 | 00:01:17:38 | Armor & hull upgrades |
| Hull Upgrades | 3 | 00:07:19:02 | More armor & hull upgrades |
| Hull Upgrades | 4 | 01:17:23:40 | Damage Control II adds a lot of EHP. Use it. |
| Mechanics | 3 | 00:03:39:30 | Armor rep equipment |
| Jury Rigging | 1 | 00:00:16:40 | Prerequisite.. |
| Jury Rigging | 2 | 00:01:17:38 | Prerequisite.. |
| Jury Rigging | 3 | 00:07:19:02 | You can now start fitting rigs! |
| Capacitor Management | 2 | 00:01:56:26 | More capacitor capacity |
| Capacitor Management | 3 | 00:10:58:34 | MORE capacitor capacity |
| CPU Management | 4 | 00:20:41:50 | More CPU output |

| Capacitor Management | 4 | 02:14:05:30 | EVEN MORE capacitor capacity |
| Hull Upgrades | 5 | 09:18:09:40 | All of the hull upgrades! |
| CPU Management | 5 | 04:21:04:50 | Maximum CPU output! |
| Powergrid Management | 5 | 04:21:04:50 | Maximum powergrid output! |

Total Training Time: __26:23:16:40__. About 27 Days, plus the Starter Kit, equals a PLEXs worth of game time. You won't have any fitting headaches afterwards though- your character is ready for the Pirate Hunter's Doctrines!
