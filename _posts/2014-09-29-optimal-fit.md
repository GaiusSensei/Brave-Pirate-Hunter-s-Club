Losing a lot of ships? Having a tough time fitting the [Pirate Hunter's Doctrines](/doctrines)? or even the BRAVE Doctrines? These are a set of essential Hull, Engineering and Rigging skills that you can train in order to help with damage mitigation and make ship fitting quite a bit easier. We suggest using these to 'pad' your training queue if there's some space at the very end. Note that these plan assumes that you have successfully completed the BRAVE Starter Kit above.
