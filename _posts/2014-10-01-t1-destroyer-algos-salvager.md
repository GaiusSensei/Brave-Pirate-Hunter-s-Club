Most wreck contain loot- modules of the ship that survived your blasters and railguns. Aside from loot though, you still extract some more items from the wreck using Salvagers. This fit is designed to comb through an entire anomalies' worth of wrecks in as little time as possible.

## Ingame Description

The Algos is a Destroyer designed to have great firepower but weak defenses.<br />
<br />
__Development__<br />
<br />
The Algos, as is custom with the Gallente, relies on swiftness of action - preferably at a respectable distance - to accomplish its goals. In this it reflects well-honed Gallente values, which include taking independent action without taking forever to wait for a committee decision, and also doing so, if at all possible, in a fashion that allows for a nice, safe buffer for immediate retreat; because theory is one thing, and practice is sometimes quite another.  As such, the Algos focuses on being able to hit its targets in rapid-fire fashion, with guns that fire fast and drones that race through space with destruction in mind.<br />
<br />
__Gallente Destroyer skill bonus per level:__

* 10% bonus to drone damage and hitpoints per level 10% bonus to small hybrid turret tracking per level

__Role Bonus:__

* 25% bonus to drone microwarpdrive speed
