Drones have always been the staple way to masacre pirates, and the Sansha's Nation menace can be dealt with via the same way. This skillplan is divided into three- one for Light Combat Drones Operation used by Frigates, another for Medium Drones used by Cruisers, and the last one for Sentry Drones used by battlecruisers and up. Note that all of these skillplans require the [BRAVE Starter Kit]({{ site.url }}/skillplans/brave-starter-kit/).<br/>

Note: All of the skills below are available for free via the [BRAVE Dojo Skillbook Program](https://wiki.braveineve.com/dojo/skillbooks).

## Attribute Optimization

If you are serious about getting this plan from start to finish, you can shave off quite a few days by optimizing your attributes (The times given above are from the default attribute spread. If you use the optimized attribute set below, the total time would be about 16 days earlier). Note that the Attribute Remaps are on a yearly timer- you wont be able to remap for an entire year.

* Reset all attributes to zero
* Max the Memory Attribute
* Put remaining points on the Perception Attribute

Also, take advantage of the [BRAVE Dojo Free Implants Program](https://wiki.braveineve.com/dojo/implants). If you have some extra ISK and you want to upgrade your implants, prioritize on the Memory Attribute first, then the Perception Attribute. Keep in mind that when you lose your character, all of their implants are destroyed.
