Unlike our HQ (EX6-AO), most of the systems you encounter will have few Combat Cosmic Signatures (or even none!). Aside from Belt Ratting, you can also use a Probe Launcher to pinpoint additional Combat Cosmic Signatures (and a few non-combat sigs for easy ISK as well).

## Ingame Description

The Imicus is a Frigate designed for exploring the depths of space.<br />
<br />
__Development__<br />
<br />
The Imicus is a slow but hard-shelled frigate, ideal for any type of scouting activity. Used by merchant, miner and combat groups, the Imicus is usually relied upon as the operation's eyes and ears when traversing low security sectors.<br />
<br />
__Gallente Frigate skill bonus per level:__

* 7.5% increase to scan strength of probes (Total: 37.5%)
* 5% bonus to Salvager cycle time (Total: 25%)

__Role Bonus:__

* +5 Virus Strength to Relic and Data Analyzers

## Flying the Ship

This ship is designed to be in a fleet (don't solo with it) and to be as expendable as possible. The standard operating procedure would probably be:

1. Warp to the system with the ratting fleet
2. Triangulate into a safe spot, then launch probes (filter for anoms)
3. Start exploring the system.
4. Send the ratting fleet to the combat anomalies
5. Claim the Data/Relic sites while waiting, OR sit in the safe spot, clear the scanner and start scanning for possible hostiles.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q. Why Expanded Probe Launcher? Fitting Probe Launcher I would make the fit easier.<br/>
A. Because this is not a Data/Relic Explorer Fit. After finding all of the Combat Anoms in a system, this fit is designed to sit in a safe spot, clear its scanner, and check if hostiles are going for the fleet. It's also good practice in case the pilot wants to do Wormholes later.<br/>
<br/>
Q. No Cloak?<br/>
A. Flying a cloaky ship in a non-cloaky fleet is kinda tricky, but if you can pull it off, then by all means fit a cloak.<br/>
<br/>
Q. Warp Core Stabilizers would help more than the Inertia Stabilizers.<br/>
A. For a solo explorer, sure. However, if you're warping with a fleet, I doubt that you'd be a primary point target- I doubt if you'd be a target at all.<br/>
