<p>The Brave Pirate Hunter's Club is a group of like-minded Eve Online players (Tranquility Server), who are members or allies of the BRAVE Alliance. We focus primarily on pirate hunting (aka "Ratting") on Catch, the Alliance's Sovereign Space. We help newbros gain ISK on the side as they help their own corporations attain their goals, as well defend our space from roaming hostile fleets.</p>
<br />
<p>We are NOT a corporation or an alliance. We do NOT shy away from PvP while on our ratting ships. We do NOT prioritize the elimination of Sansha's Nation ships over Corporation or Alliance Strat Ops. We do NOT tolerate bigotry.</p>  

## How to Join
* First, you must be a member of a corporation with the BRAVE Alliance, or one of their allies (HERO Coalition)
* Next, hang out on "BRAVE Sansha's Massacre" ingame chat channel
* There's no Skill Points Requirement, fees or interviews. You may leave whenever you want as well.

## Hunting Grounds

The Brave Pirate Hunter's Club is based primarilly on EX6-AO, one of the tradehubs of the Catch region. This system also has several Asteroid Belts for trying out fits, Combat Anomalies for ISK generation, as well as SOUND's Defence Fleet. We are also three jumps away from BRAVE HQ, in case there's a Strat Op. Our primary hunting grounds are:  

* EX6-AO   
* 407-MU (EX6-AO has a friendly jump bridge directly to this -1.0 system, the most profitable security rating in the game)  
* RR-D05 (Dangerously close to the Black Pearl Alliance systems)  
* 7LHB-Z & G-7WUF (7+ Jumps aways from HQ with jump bridges, but less chance of encountering a roaming fleet)  

## Fleets & Events

As of now, fleets (ratting or otherwise) will be unscheduled; feel free to start one or ask people in the channel. There are also no planned events yet, both ingame or in real life. This will change in the near future, as we gain more members.
