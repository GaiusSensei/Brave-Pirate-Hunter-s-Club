# [Brave Pirate Hunter's Club](http://gaiussensei.github.io/Brave-Pirate-Hunter-s-Club)

The Brave Pirate Hunter's Club is an inclusive organization within EvE Online that is accessible to any member of the BRAVE Alliance and any of its allies. We are aiming to be the premier pirate hunting group in our alliance, and keep the Sansha's Nation menace away from Catch.

Note: We are NOT a corporation, but rather a group of like-minded individuals. Our unofficial HQ is at Catch EX6-AO, and we are on the In-game Chat Channels: BRAVE Sansha's Massacre and of course the standard HERO Intel channels. We use the BRAVE Comms when necessary, as well as the BRAVE Forums & [Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bravenewbies/).

Our [website](http://gaiussensei.github.io/Brave-Pirate-Hunter-s-Club) will contain the following:

* 7o Etiquette: The Brave Pirate Hunter's Club is a Classy Organization. Bigotry is NOT tolerated.
* Hunter's Skillplan: Training from Zero to Master Hunter in least amount of Skill Points
* Hunter's Doctrines: Welcome to the Gallente Master Race
* Catch Hunting Grounds: Where to find (and kill) the Sansha Menace

## Frequently Asked Questions:  
Q. Are you a Corporation?  
A. No. We are, at best, an unofficial chat channel.

Q. How can I join?  
A. First, join any of the BRAVE Alliance corporations, then join our in-game chat channel "BRAVE Sansha's Massacre" (no quotes). There are no SP requirements.
